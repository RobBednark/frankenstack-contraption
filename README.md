# ðŸ§ª The Frankenstack Contraption

A Rube Goldberg web app, intentionally composed of an ever-growing kitchen sink of popular tech (cloud services, languages, frameworks, libraries,  ...) for my curiosity and exploration.

## Purpose

- To touch and explore a wide range of technologies.

- To experience firsthand how each piece works at a basic level.

- To meet the challenge of wiring them all together in a working system.
